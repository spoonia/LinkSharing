If you are interested in the sample codes and screen shots I mentioned above, you can run the sample application in your own machine by installing
it to your project using the following command:

{code}
grails install-sampleapp
{code}

{note}
The command above not supported since 1.3 released, you may download the sample app created for [Grails 1.3.9 using Grails standard theme|http://jquery-validation-ui-plugin.googlecode.com/files/jqvalui-g139.zip] or [Grails 2.1.0 using Twitter Bootstrap theme|http://jquery-validation-ui-plugin.googlecode.com/files/jqvalui-g210.zip].
